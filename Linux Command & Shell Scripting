First, four main parts make up a Linux system:
	- The Linux kernel
	- The GNU utilities
	- A graphical desktop environment
	- Application software
Each of these parts has a specific job in the Linux system. No part is very useful by itself


** The core of the Linux system is the kernel. The kernel controls all the hardware and software on the computer system,
allocating hardware when necessary and executing software when required.

The GNU organization (GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix) developed a complete set of Unix utilities, but had no kernel system to run them on.
These utilities were developed under a software philosophy called open source software (OSS).

The concept of OSS allows programmers to develop software and then release it to the world with no licensing fees attached.
Anyone can use the software, modify it, or incorporate it into his or her own system without having to pay a license fee.
Uniting Linus's Linux kernel with the GNU operating system utilities created a complete, functional, free operating system.


The Shell:
-The GNU/Linux shell is a special interactive utility. It provides a way for users to start programs, manage files on the filesystem, and manage processes running on the Linux system.
 The core of the shell is the command prompt. The command prompt is the interactive part of the shell. It allows you to enter text commands, and then it interprets the commands and
 executes them in the kernel

Commands:
- The cd command syntax is pretty simplistic: cd destination.
- An absolute directory reference always begins with a forward slash (/), indicating the virtual directory system's root.
- The pwd command displays the shell session's current directory location, which is called the present working directory
- ls -F displays where you are at in a list
- The -R parameter is another option the ls command can use. Called the recursive option, it shows files that are contained within subdirectories in the current directory.
 If you have lots of subdirectories, this can be quite a long listing (ls -F -R)
- you can use the touch command to easily create an empty file: touch thisIsAFile
- Copying files and directories from one location in the filesystem to another is a common practice for system administrators. The cp command provides this feature.
- The command to remove files in the bash shell is rm (rm -i fileName) then (ls -l fileName) its gone!
- Creating a new directory in Linux is easy — just use the mkdir command
- To create several directories and subdirectories at the same time, you need to add the -p parameter
- The basic command for removing a directory is rmdir.The rmdir has no -i option to ask if you want to remove the directory.
 This is one reason it is helpful that rmdir removes only empty directories.
- The file command is a handy little utility to have around. It can peek inside of a file and determine just what kind of file it is
- The cat command is a handy tool for displaying all the data inside a text file
- The -n parameter numbers all the lines for you for the cat command
- If you just want to number the lines that have text in them, the -b parameter is for you (cat -b fileName)
- The tail command displays the last lines in a file (the file's “tail”). By default, it shows the last 10 lines in the file.
- The -f parameter is a pretty cool feature of the tail command. It allows you to peek inside a file as the file is being used by other processes.
 The tail command stays active and continues to display new lines as they appear in the text file. This is a great way to monitor the system log files in real-time mode.
